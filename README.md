# CNUSLib

[JNUSLib](https://github.com/Maschell/JNUSLib) is a library written in Java to handle NUS Contents (.app, tmd, tik, cert files) from different sources. It can be easily used in other Applications and is directed to devolpers. It's based on JNUSTool, but is heavily rewritten and extented with even more features.

CNUSLib is a partial port to .NET (C#) of JNUSLib

# Differences to JNUSLib

At the moment, CNUSLib only supports decryption and extraction from WUD files.

The following features have not yet been ported to .NET (though they are planned to be):
 - Support for split WUD files
 - Support for WUX files
 - Support for Woomey files
 - Some of the Hash checks
 - The Download Service
